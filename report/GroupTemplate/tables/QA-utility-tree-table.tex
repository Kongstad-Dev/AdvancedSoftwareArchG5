\hline
\textbf{Quality Attribute} & \textbf{Attribute Refinement} & \textbf{ASR Scenario} \\
\hline

Availability &
Failover during peak production &
A primary sensor fails during peak production. The system promotes a backup sensor to primary within 10 seconds with no data loss. (H, H) \\
\hline

Deployability &
Rolling update of services &
A new service version is deployed while the system is running. The update proceeds incrementally with no downtime and service availability is maintained. (M, M) \\
\hline

Interoperability &
Integration of legacy devices &
A legacy device using MQTT or a proprietary protocol is connected. An adapter translates messages into canonical Kafka events without changes to core services. (M, M) \\
\hline

Performance &
End-to-end event processing latency &
A sensor heartbeat or event is generated. The system processes and persists the event within a defined latency threshold. (H, H) \\
\hline

Scalability &
High sensor load &
500 concurrent sensors per factory send data simultaneously. The system maintains stable processing across multiple factories with no backlog and bounded latency. (H, H) \\
\hline
